## Why Start Another Swift Podcast?

Hi Everyone,

My name is David and you’re listening to the Swift Raw Podcast.
I’ll keep this brief because that’s the point of this whole podcast.
I listen to a lot of software engineering podcasts and there are a lot of great ones out there.

I’ve noticed one thing though… there is a lot of talk and general chat among hosts… which is great, but when I’m really in the mood to learn about something new or to catch up on the latest developments I just want the information. That's not to say I never want to hear a conversation about software engineering, in fact that’s often exactly what I want and there are lots of great podcasts where you can get that, there just aren’t a lot that I’ve found that get right to the point of a topic. So that’s why I’ve decided to start this new podcast: #"Swift Raw"#

My goal is to create a podcast you can come to to learn about Swift and iOS development in small chunks that deliver the kind of information that will be helpful to you in conversations in interviews, on the job with co-workers or even with your boss.

When you want to learn a new language one of the best ways to learn is to really steep yourself in the language. The same way that spanish language learning audio books help you with Spanish pronunciation, vocabulary and phrasing. My hope is that the next time someone asks you to explain ARC, the app lifecycle or the difference between unit testing, UI testing and integration testing in iOS you’ll be able to confidently answer like the professional developer you are.

That is also the goal I have for myself. I’ve started this podcast becuase I also hope that listening to the reppetition of these concepts and fundamentals of Swift and iOS development will also benefit me as an engineer. And of course I’d like to share that benefit with other engineers and contribute back to a community that has been so helpful to me in my journey as an iOS developer.

## Podcast Structure and Contributions

I'd like to quickly discuss the structure of this podcast and let you know how you can hopefully get the most out of it. Each individual podcast will be focused on a single topic like: App Lifecycle. I will keep the intro and outro minimal for each episode to keep the topics as composable by you as possible. My hope is you'll be able to use your podcast app of choice to subscribe to this podcast and then build a playlist for yourself based on topics you're interested in. There will be no need to listen to the show in any order. You should be able to simply find something that is interesting to you and add it to your playlist to listen to.

I will use Apple documentation as a first source, but I plan to use other sources as well. I will list these sources in the show notes for each podcast. The show notes will also contain the content of each episode and they will be available on Github.com at https://github.com/normand1/SwiftRawPodcast. You'll also be able to find a link to the podcast notes at davidwnorman.com.

If you hear something while you're listening to the podcast that is wrong and you'd like me to correct it, please open a PR to the show notes and I will update the podcast as soon as possible. Swift is a young and frequently changing language (less so now than before, but still) and I plan on upkeeping older episodes with newer information when the information for that episode is out of date. Because this is not a serialized podcast I hope for old episodes to be just as correct and useful as newer episodes in the future.

Alright, here we go, thanks for listening!
