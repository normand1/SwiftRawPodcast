# Basic Operators

An operator is a special symbol or phrase that you use to check, 
change, or combine values. For example, the addition operator (+) 
adds two numbers, as in let i = 1 + 2, and the logical AND 
operator (&&) combines two Boolean values, as in if enteredDoorCode 
&& passedRetinaScan.

Swift supports most standard C operators and improves several 
capabilities to eliminate common coding errors. The assignment 
operator (=) doesn’t return a value, to prevent it from being 
mistakenly used when the equal to operator (==) is intended. 
Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, % and so forth) detect and 
disallow value overflow, to avoid unexpected results when 
working with numbers that become larger or smaller than the 
allowed value range of the type that stores them. You can opt 
in to value overflow behavior by using Swift’s overflow 
operators, as described in Overflow Operators.

Swift also provides range operators that aren’t found in C, 
such as a..<b and a...b, as a shortcut for expressing a range 
of values.

## Terminology

Operators are unary, binary, or ternary:

- Unary operators operate on a single target (such as -a). 
Unary prefix operators appear immediately before their target 
(such as !b), and unary postfix operators appear immediately 
after their target (such as c!).

- Binary operators operate on two targets (such as 2 + 3) and are 
infix because they appear in between their two targets.

- Ternary operators operate on three targets. Like C, Swift has 
only one ternary operator, the ternary conditional operator 
(a ? b : c).

The values that operators affect are operands. In the expression 
1 + 2, the + symbol is a binary operator and its two operands 
are the values 1 and 2.

## Logical Operators

The logical operators in Swift are the Logical AND, Logical NOT, and Logical OR.

You can combine logical operators in Swift.

```
NOTE
The Swift logical operators && and || are left-associative, meaning
 that compound expressions with multiple logical operators evaluate 
 the leftmost subexpression first.
