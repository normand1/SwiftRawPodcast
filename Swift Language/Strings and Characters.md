# Strings and Characters

A string is a series of characters, such as "hello, world" or 
"albatross". Swift strings are represented by the String type. 
The contents of a String can be accessed in various ways, 
including as a collection of Character values.

Swift‚Äôs String and Character types provide a fast, Unicode-compliant way to work with text in your code. The syntax for string creation and manipulation is lightweight and readable, with a string literal syntax that is similar to C. String concatenation is as simple as
 combining two strings with the + operator, and string mutability is managed by choosing between a constant or a variable, just like any other value in Swift. You can also use strings to insert constants, variables, literals, and expressions into longer strings, in a process known as string interpolation. This makes it easy to create custom string values for display, storage, and printing.

Despite this simplicity of syntax, Swift‚Äôs String type is a fast, modern string implementation. Every string is composed of encoding-independent Unicode characters, and provides support for accessing those characters in various Unicode representations.

```
NOTE

Swift‚Äôs String type is bridged with Foundation‚Äôs NSString class. Foundation also extends String to expose methods defined by NSString. This means, if you import Foundation, you can access those NSString methods on String without casting.
```

## String Literals

You can include predefined String values within your code as string literals. A string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotation marks (").

## Multiline String Literals

If you need a string that spans several lines, use a multiline string literal‚Äîa sequence of characters surrounded by three double quotation marks.

A multiline string literal includes all of the lines between its opening and closing quotation marks. The string begins on the first line after the opening quotation marks (""") and ends on the line before the closing quotation marks.

When your source code includes a line break inside of a multiline string literal, that line break also appears in the string‚Äôs value. If you want to use line breaks to make your source code easier to read, but you don‚Äôt want the line breaks to be part of the string‚Äôs value, write a backslash (\) at the end of those lines.

To make a multiline string literal that begins or ends with a line feed, write a blank line as the first or last line.

A multiline string can be indented to match the surrounding code. The whitespace before the closing quotation marks (""") tells Swift what whitespace to ignore before all of the other lines. However, if you write whitespace at the beginning of a line in addition to what‚Äôs before the closing quotation marks, that whitespace is included.

## Special Characters in String Literals

String literals can include the following special characters:

The escaped special characters \0 (null character), \\ (backslash), \t (horizontal tab), \n (line feed), \r (carriage return), \" (double quotation mark) and \' (single quotation mark)
An arbitrary Unicode scalar value, written as \u{n}, where n is a 1‚Äì8 digit hexadecimal number (Unicode is discussed in Unicode below)

```
Example: The string literal to represent a dollar sign is  "\u{24}"
```

## Working with Characters

You can access the individual Character values for a String by iterating over the string with a for-in loop.

You can break down a String into an Array of Characters by casting a String to an Array.

## String Interpolation

String interpolation is a way to construct a new String value from a mix of constants, variables, literals, and expressions by including their values inside a string literal. You can use string interpolation in both single-line and multiline string literals. Each item that you insert into the string literal is wrapped in a pair of parentheses, prefixed by a backslash (\)

Since Swift 5 you can add extended string delimiters to create strings containing characters that would otherwise be treated as a string interpolation. String Delimiters are number signs placed at the beginning and end of a string's double quotation marks. Using string delimiters are very useful when working with Regular Expressions because any backslashes in a regular string literal would need to be escaped. When a regular expression is written with extended delimiters escape characters for backslashes are not necessary.

## Strings Are Value Types

Swift‚Äôs String type is a value type. If you create a new String value, that String value is copied when it‚Äôs passed to a function or method, or when it‚Äôs assigned to a constant or variable. In each case, a new copy of the existing String value is created, and the new copy is passed or assigned, not the original version.

Swift‚Äôs copy-by-default String behavior ensures that when a function or method passes you a String value, it‚Äôs clear that you own that exact String value, regardless of where it came from. You can be confident that the string you are passed won‚Äôt be modified unless you modify it yourself.

Behind the scenes, Swift‚Äôs compiler optimizes string usage so that actual copying takes place only when absolutely necessary. This means you always get great performance when working with strings as value types.

## Unicode

## Unicode Scalar Values

Behind the scenes, Swift‚Äôs native String type is built from Unicode scalar values. A Unicode scalar value is a unique 21-bit number for a character or modifier, such as U+0061 for LATIN SMALL LETTER A ("a"), or U+1F425 for FRONT-FACING BABY CHICK ("üê•").

Note that not all 21-bit Unicode scalar values are assigned to a character‚Äîsome scalars are reserved for future assignment or for use in UTF-16 encoding. Scalar values that have been assigned to a character typically also have a name, such as LATIN SMALL LETTER A and FRONT-FACING BABY CHICK as previously stated.

## Extended Grapheme Clusters

Every instance of Swift‚Äôs Character type represents a single extended grapheme cluster. An extended grapheme cluster is a sequence of one or more Unicode scalars that (when combined) produce a single human-readable character.

Here‚Äôs an example. The letter e-accute ( that is the letter e with a small accent mark sitting on top of it - √©) can be represented as the single Unicode scalar (LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE, or U+00E9). However, the same letter can also be represented as a pair of scalars ‚Äî a standard letter e (LATIN SMALL LETTER E, or U+0065), followed by the COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT scalar (U+0301). The COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT scalar is graphically applied to the scalar that precedes it, turning an e into an e-accute (√©) when it‚Äôs rendered by a Unicode-aware text-rendering system.

In both cases, the letter e-accute (√©) is represented as a single Swift Character value that represents an extended grapheme cluster. In the first case, the cluster contains a single scalar; in the second case, it‚Äôs a cluster of two scalars:

This becomes very important when we discuss the counting of Characters.

## Counting Characters

To retrieve a count of the Character values in a string, use the `count` property of the string

Note that Swift‚Äôs use of extended grapheme clusters for Character values means that string concatenation and modification may not always affect a string‚Äôs character count.

For example, if you initialize a new string with the four-character word cafe, and then append a COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT (U+0301) to the end of the string, the resulting string will still have a character count of 4 because the final character in cafe will have been modified from a standard latin e character to the e-accute character which is the result of appending Unicode character U+301.

```
NOTE

Extended grapheme clusters can be composed of multiple Unicode scalars. This means that different characters‚Äîand different representations of the same character‚Äîcan require different amounts of memory to store. Because of this, characters in Swift don‚Äôt each take up the same amount of memory within a string‚Äôs representation. As a result, the number of characters in a string can‚Äôt be calculated without iterating through the string to determine its extended grapheme cluster boundaries. If you are working with particularly long string values, be aware that the count property must iterate over the Unicode scalars in the entire string in order to determine the characters for that string.

The count of the characters returned by the count property isn‚Äôt always the same as the length property of an NSString that contains the same characters. The length of an NSString is based on the number of 16-bit code units within the string‚Äôs UTF-16 representation and not the number of Unicode extended grapheme clusters within the string.
```
## Accessing and Modifying a String

You access and modify a string through its methods and properties, or by using subscript syntax.

## String Indices
Each String value has an associated index type, String.Index, which corresponds to the position of each Character in the string.

As mentioned above, different characters can require different amounts of memory to store, so in order to determine which Character is at a particular position, you must iterate over each Unicode scalar from the start or end of that String. For this reason, Swift strings can‚Äôt be indexed by integer values.

Use the startIndex property to access the position of the first Character of a String. The endIndex property is the position after the last character in a String. As a result, the endIndex property isn‚Äôt a valid argument to a string‚Äôs subscript. If a String is empty, startIndex and endIndex are equal.

You access the indices before and after a given index using the index(before:) and index(after:) methods of String. To access an index farther away from the given index, you can use the index(_:offsetBy:) method instead of calling one of these methods multiple times.

You can use subscript syntax to access the Character at a particular String index.

Attempting to access an index outside of a string‚Äôs range or a Character at an index outside of a string‚Äôs range will trigger a runtime error.

You can use the indices property of a string to access all of the indices of individual characters in a string.

## Substrings

When you get a substring from a string‚Äîfor example, using a subscript or a method like prefix(_:)‚Äîthe result is an instance of Substring, not another string. Substrings in Swift have most of the same methods as strings, which means you can work with substrings the same way you work with strings. However, unlike strings, you use substrings for only a short amount of time while performing actions on a string. When you‚Äôre ready to store the result for a longer time, you should convert the substring to an instance of String.

Like strings, each substring has a region of memory where the characters that make up the substring are stored. The difference between strings and substrings is that, as a performance optimization, a substring can reuse part of the memory that‚Äôs used to store the original string, or part of the memory that‚Äôs used to store another substring. (Strings have a similar optimization, but if two strings share memory, they are equal.) This performance optimization means you don‚Äôt have to pay the performance cost of copying memory until you modify either the string or substring. As mentioned above, substrings aren‚Äôt suitable for long-term storage‚Äîbecause they reuse the storage of the original string, the entire original string must be kept in memory as long as any of its substrings are being used.

```
NOTE

Both String and Substring conform to the StringProtocol protocol, which means it‚Äôs often convenient for string-manipulation functions to accept a StringProtocol value. You can call such functions with either a String or Substring value.
```

## Comparing Strings

Swift provides three ways to compare textual values: string and character equality, prefix equality, and suffix equality.

## Strings and Character Equality

For example, LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE (U+00E9) is canonically equivalent to LATIN SMALL LETTER E (U+0065) followed by COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT (U+0301). Both of these extended grapheme clusters are valid ways to represent the character √©, and so they‚Äôre considered to be canonically equivalent

Conversely, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0041, or "A"), as used in English, is not equivalent to CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0410, or "–ê"), as used in Russian. The characters are visually similar, but don‚Äôt have the same linguistic meaning.

```
NOTE

String and character comparisons in Swift are not locale-sensitive.
```

## Prefix and Suffix Equality

To check whether a string has a particular string prefix or suffix, call the string‚Äôs hasPrefix(_:) and hasSuffix(_:) methods, both of which take a single argument of type String and return a Boolean value.

For example take the three strings:

"Act 1 Scene 1: Verona, A public place",
"Act 1 Scene 2: Capulet's mansion" and
"Act 1 Scene 3: A room in Capulet's mansion"

You could use the hasPrefix(_:) method with the parameter "Act 1" and find that all three strings contained the same prefix. You could also use the has Suffix(_:) method with the parameter "Capulet's mansion" to find that two of the three strings contained that suffix.

```
NOTE

The hasPrefix(_:) and hasSuffix(_:) methods perform a character-by-character canonical equivalence comparison between the extended grapheme clusters in each string
```

## Unicode Representations of Strings

When a Unicode string is written to a text file or some other storage, the Unicode scalars in that string are encoded in one of several Unicode-defined encoding forms. Each form encodes the string in small chunks known as code units. These include the UTF-8 encoding form (which encodes a string as 8-bit code units), the UTF-16 encoding form (which encodes a string as 16-bit code units), and the UTF-32 encoding form (which encodes a string as 32-bit code units).

Swift provides several different ways to access Unicode representations of strings. You can iterate over the string with a for-in statement, to access its individual Character values as Unicode extended grapheme clusters. 

Alternatively, access a String value in one of three other Unicode-compliant representations:

- A collection of UTF-8 code units (accessed with the string‚Äôs utf8 property)
- A collection of UTF-16 code units (accessed with the string‚Äôs utf16 property)
- A collection of 21-bit Unicode scalar values, equivalent to the string‚Äôs UTF-32 encoding form (accessed with the string‚Äôs unicodeScalars property)
